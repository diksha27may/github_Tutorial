Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their
type. Every variable in Python is an object.

Numbers:-
myint = 7
print(myint)

myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)

Strings:-
mystring = 'hello'
print(mystring)
mystring = "hello"
print(mystring)

mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
print(mystring)

Assignments can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same line like this

a, b = 3, 4
print(a,b)

# change this code
mystring = "hello"
myfloat =10.0
myint = 20

# testing code
if mystring == "hello":
    print("String: %s" % mystring)
if isinstance(myfloat, float) and myfloat == 10.0:
    print("Float: %f" % myfloat)
if isinstance(myint, int) and myint == 20:
    print("Integer: %d" % myint)
