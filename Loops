There are two types of loops in Python, for and while.

The "FOR"  loop:-
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).


Example:-
Print Each Fruit In A Fruit List:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  
  Looping Through A String:-
  
  Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

Example:-
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
  
  The BREAK Statement:-
  With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 
  if x == "banana":
    break
Example:-

Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)
  
  The CONTINUE Satatement:-
  
  With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

Example:-
do not print bananana

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)
