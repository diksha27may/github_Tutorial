Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also
be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.

numbers = [1,2,3]
strings = ['hello','world']
names = ["John", "Eric", "Jessica"]

# write your code here
second_name = 3

# this code should write out the filled arrays and the second name in the names list (Eric).
print(numbers)
print(strings)
print("The second name on the names list is %s" % second_name)
