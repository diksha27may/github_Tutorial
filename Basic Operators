Arithmetic Operatoes:-

number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
print(number)

Another operator available is the modulo (%) operator, which returns the integer remainder of the division. dividend % divisor = remainder.

remainder = 11 % 3
print(remainder)

Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.

squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3
print(squared)
print(cubed)

Using Operators With Strings:-

Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:

helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
print(helloworld)

Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:

Using Operators With Lists:-

Lists can be joined with the addition operators:

even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
print(all_numbers)

Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:

print([1,2,3] * 3)
